# Kiwi the Chameleon 
Kiwi: Criminal Chameleon is a pixel art 2D platformer in which a mischievous young chameleon uses his camouflage abilities to rob a grocery store to satiate his humongous appetite. In this game, players must collect the specified fruit on their grocery list while staying out of sight of the grocery store's many security cameras and patrolling fruit fly security guards. To do this, Kiwi may activate his camouflage powerup or disarm the patrols using his long tongue. Once Kiwi successfully collects all of the fruit on his grocery list by hopping across the various shelves, he speeds away in a shopping cart to enjoy his snack. However, if he is caught in the act, he is taken into custody and imprisoned for his crimes.
